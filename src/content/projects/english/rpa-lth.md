For Consorcio Carolina, we developed a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solution using Python and its advanced libraries. The RPA, specifically designed for the Lake Titicaca Hotel (LTH) in Puno, automates the daily download of critical reports related to hotel arrivals and room occupancy. This system automatically connects to the hotel’s Remote Desktop (RDP), accesses the internal software, and extracts data in a structured manner. Initially, the RPA processes historical information from previous years, ensuring the consolidation of complete and updated data. Subsequently, it continues to extract new reports daily, standardizing them for consistent processing. The processed data is stored in SharePoint lists, triggering an automated workflow that updates a Power BI dashboard designed for management. This real-time reporting facilitates supervision and strategic decision-making.

### Benefits of the Service

The development of this RPA provides the following key benefits:

1. Complete Automation: Eliminates repetitive manual tasks, saving time and reducing human errors.  
2. Data Centralization: All reports are systematically stored in a SharePoint database.  
3. Real-Time Access: Management can monitor updated data through Power BI integration.  
4. Efficient Data Processing: Disorganized data is automatically transformed into a standardized format ready for analysis.  
5. User-Friendly Interface: The RPA includes an executable interface that is easy to use, installed on the PCs of responsible users.  
6. Scalability: The solution's design allows adaptation to other processes or hotel areas if needed.  
7. Daily Automatic Updates: After completing the historical load, new data is extracted and processed automatically each day.  

### Business Strategy

To ensure the project's success, AVR Solutions implemented the following strategies:  

1. Optimization of Manual Processes  
2. Generating Value with Data  
3. Adoption of Modern Technology  

### Analyze Your Business

The implemented solution not only digitizes previously manual and error-prone processes but also enables Consorcio Carolina and Lake Titicaca Hotel to operate with accurate, organized, and real-time data. Automating operational tasks frees up human resources to focus on higher-value strategic activities, while the integrated Power BI reporting provides management with a consolidated view for monitoring the hotel’s performance. This project strengthens the client’s ability to respond swiftly to market demands, improving operational efficiency and facilitating data-driven decision-making.
