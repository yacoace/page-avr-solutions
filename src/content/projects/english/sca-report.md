AVR Solutions developed an integrated Power BI Application called SCA Report (Stability Capability Assessment Report) for Astay Systems. This solution was designed to enable managers and collaborators to add, edit, audit, or approve comments in real-time directly from the Power BI report. This dashboard displayed key data about the internal operations of an entire mining process, such as tonnage extraction, hauling, and fleet management, allowing informed decisions on performance stability. The application was built using Power Platform, enabling seamless integration within the Power BI report, eliminating the need for additional screens or external links. This solution was tailored to 7 specific use cases defined by Astay Systems, ensuring flexibility and customized functionality for each scenario.

### Benefits of the Service

The development of this application provides the following key benefits:

1. Direct Integration: Enables real-time interaction with the Power BI report without leaving the platform.  
2. Custom Management: Differentiated access levels for adding, editing, auditing, or approving comments based on user roles.  
3. Flexible Design: Customization for 7 use cases, adapting to various screens and specific data types.  
4. Informed Decision-Making: Real-time comments linked directly to key mining performance metrics.  
5. Workflow Optimization: Eliminates manual and external processes by centralizing comment management on a single platform.  
6. Scalability and Security: Power Platform and Power BI ensure a reliable and adaptable solution for future requirements.  

### Business Strategy

To ensure the project's success, AVR Solutions implemented the following strategies:  

1. Adaptability to Client Requirements  
2. Technological Innovation  
3. Focus on User Experience  

### Analyze Your Business

The project addressed a critical need for Astay Systems: enabling centralized, real-time comment management within a Power BI report, eliminating manual processes and enhancing analysis and decision-making capabilities. By integrating critical mining operational data with dynamic comment functionality, the application delivered a comprehensive and tailored solution that strengthened the quality of service provided to its mining client.
