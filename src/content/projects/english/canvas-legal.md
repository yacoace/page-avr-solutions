A solution was developed to enable legal departments to monitor and manage the key objectives and results (OKRs) established according to the methodology implemented by Canvas Legal. This solution, built on Microsoft’s Power Platform, leverages tools such as Power Apps, SharePoint, Power Automate, and Power BI, integrating collaboration and automation capabilities already available within the Microsoft Office 365 environment.

The application is designed to be accessible from both web browsers and mobile devices, offering a seamless and user-friendly experience. Its real-time functionality allows users to update task statuses, change descriptions, assign responsibilities, add comments, and monitor progress toward established goals. Additionally, it integrates automated workflows that send scheduled alerts when tasks are nearing their deadlines or when modifications are made, ensuring continuous and effective tracking.

### Benifits of service

The developed solution provides multiple advantages to companies seeking to maximize the management of their legal OKRs:

1. Effective Monitoring: Real-time tracking of progress toward key objectives, ensuring deadlines are met.
2. Universal Access: Accessible via web or mobile devices, enabling users to manage tasks from anywhere.
3. Resource Optimization: Utilization of free tools included in Microsoft Office 365 licenses, minimizing additional costs.
4. Alert Automation: Power Automate workflows send automatic notifications, reducing the risk of missed deadlines.
5. Scalability and Security: SharePoint serves as a centralized database, ensuring secure and expandable management.
6. Simplified Collaboration: Intuitive interface facilitates team collaboration, improving productivity and internal communication.

### Business Strategy

To ensure the success of the project, AVR Solutions implemented a business strategy focused on:

1. Leveraging Existing Infrastructure
2. Emphasizing User Experience
3. Automation and Tracking

### Analyze your business

The development of this application addresses the critical need for companies to effectively manage their legal OKRs, a common challenge due to underutilization of technological tools already included in their Microsoft Office 365 licenses. By providing a customized and automated solution, internal processes are optimized, manual tasks are reduced, and continuous tracking of goal compliance is ensured. This not only improves the productivity of legal departments but also strengthens companies’ ability to meet their strategic goals within established deadlines, generating a positive impact on overall performance.
